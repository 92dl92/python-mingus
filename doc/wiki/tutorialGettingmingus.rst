Getting mingus
==============

The latest source package (in `tar.gz` format) can be found in `the github releases <https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus/releases>`_. 
A windows installer can be found there as well.

The latest source, as well as the windows installer are also available at [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mingus/ Python's Package Index],
which means you can also use `easyinstall mingus` and `pip install mingus`.

And last but not least: you can choose to check out the latest version from the mingus' git repository with the command:

`git clone https://github.com/bspaans/python-mingus.git`
